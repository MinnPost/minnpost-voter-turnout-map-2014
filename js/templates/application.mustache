      <p>&dagger;"Minnesota's statewide turnout is officially reported using the eligible voter estimate from the United States Elections Project, which more accurately accounts for all eligibility factors. The data [provided] does not take into account some eligibility factors, and so varies slightly from the official statewide number. For comparison, 2014 statewide turnout is officially 50.51%, versus 51.29% using the data below.  Registration rate data based on number of registrations by start of voting on Election Day, November 4, 2014. It does not include voters who registered on Election Day."
